# ðŸ¦Œ The reno race

### Description

It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.

The information you receive:

* indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
* 0: The lane is empty.
* Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
* Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
* length: The length of each lane.

Return a string representing the race track:

* Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
* Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
* Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
* The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.

Examples:
```js
drawRace([0, 5, -3], 10)
/*
  ~~~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/

drawRace([2, -1, 0, 5], 8)
/*
   ~~r~~~~~ /1
  ~~~~~~~r /2
 ~~~~~~~~ /3
~~~~~r~~ /4
*/

drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12)
/*
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~~~~r~~~ /2
~~~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/
```

### Solution (5/5 stars)

```js
function drawRace(indices, length) {
  let temp = [];
  
  for(let i=0, y=indices.length - 1; i<indices.length; i++, y--) {
    const offset = ' '.repeat(y);
    let line = '~'.repeat(length);
    let newLine = line.split('');
    
    if(indices[i] > 0) {
      newLine[indices[i]] = 'r';
    } else if (indices[i] < 0) {
      newLine[length+indices[i]] = 'r';
    }
  
    line = newLine.join('');
    temp.push(`${offset}${line} /${i + 1}`);
  }
  
  return temp.join('\n');
}
```
